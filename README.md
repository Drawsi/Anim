# Anim
- Although what I have made so far can only be called rudimentary it is still the foundation of a piece of software I hope to see in the future replace the current ones on the market.

- There are plenty of great animation software out there which I have personally tried but they all seem to fall short in some ways: some have a steep learning curve( I'm looking at you OpenToonz), others are too buggy to be called useful (Pencil2D), some you can only use to animate stick figures, some are not that fun to use although powerful (Blender) while a big part of the software that gets all those things right are priced high enough that I'd like to pirate the software out of spite (AnimateCC). There's also Macromedia Flash 8, it's predecessor which although overall great, has problems with the zoom changing the line width and needing an external program to render the frames.

- I'd like to go as far as possible with this project, and who knows? Maybe one day It'll be a half-decent program.
