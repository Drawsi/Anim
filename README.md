# Anim
- Although what I have made so far can only be called rudimentary it is still the foundation of a piece of software I hope to use in the future to replace the current ones on the market. 

- There are plenty of great animation software out there which I have personally tried but they all seem to fall short on making simple, concise guides on using their software; sometimes such guides cannot be made due to their structure. 

- I aim to design something not only easy to pick up on but also complex enough to make it a versatile tool.
