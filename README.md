# Anim
- Although what I have made so far can only be called rudimentary it is still the foundation of a piece of software I hope to see in the future replace the current ones on the market.

- There are plenty of great animation software out there which I have personally tried but they all seem to fall short in some ways: some have a steep learning curve (**OpenToonz**), others are too buggy to be called useful (**Pencil2d**), some you can only use to animate stick figures (**Pivot animator**), some are not that fun to use although powerful (**Blender**) while a big part of the few pieces of software that gets all of those things right are priced high enough that I'd like to pirate them out of spite (**AnimateCC & ToonBoom**). There's also **Macromedia Flash 8**, it's predecessor which although free and overall great, has problems with the zoom changing the line width and needing an external program to render the animation.

- I'd like to go as far as possible with this project, and who knows? Maybe one day It'll be a half-decent program.
